# h2m-parser-rs

Library to parse Heroes 2 map files (*.fh2m). Current scope is only to parse map metadata. It aims to support The Price of Loyalty maps (version 2) and latest format of FHeroes2 maps (version 9). While it also supports extracting some
metadata from original Heroes 2 maps which have different format, this will not be actively developed since original maps are hard to come by.
